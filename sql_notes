>>> A view is a stored SQL statement.it acts like a table but 
doesn't have the data stored on the disk, whearas Materialized 
view acts as a table having the data stored on the disk.


>>> generally its better to use access data through views rather
than the actual tables of the DB, sometimes the DB admin wants
to change a column name of a certain table, rather than changing 
it, and telling the developers, data engineers etc. to make the
same change, he can create a view, asign the same column on the 
view to the new column name and voila. no need to tell everyone 
about the change.


>>> the difference between truncate and delete is that if we're 
using for example an autoincrement column like id column, if you 
insert a new row it will take the last value + 1 if you used the 
delete statment, while truncate initialize the counter to 1.


>>> INDEXES: 
1- CLUSTERED Index : it orders the rows data inside the data pages
for example if we create an index on FIRST_NAME column, the rows 
will be ordered alphabeticaly based on the FIRST_NAME.


>>> TRANSACTION
In a database context, a transaction is every statment that update
the data inside the database, it could be an INSERT statment, UPDATE
or DELETE statment etc.


>>> BUFFER POOL 
is the place in the RAM where MySQL loads data pages for handling 
transactions
