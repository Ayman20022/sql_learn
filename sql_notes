>>> A view is a stored SQL statement.it acts like a table but 
doesn't have the data stored on the disk, whearas Materialized 
view acts as a table having the data stored on the disk.


>>> generally its better to use access data through views rather
than the actual tables of the DB, sometimes the DB admin wants
to change a column name of a certain table, rather than changing 
it, and telling the developers, data engineers etc. to make the
same change, he can create a view, asign the same column on the 
view to the new column name and voila. no need to tell everyone 
about the change.
